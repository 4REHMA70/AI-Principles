# AI-Principles

Project on search algorithms.
Install all necessary libraries utilised in Main.py and run.

The config.py contains configurations for the map and search algorithms. Options include visualizing vs just displaying final details (memory, time, path taken, etc). The user can set configurations to single run as true or false (indicating multiple runs); if single, then the user can choose to keep a static map with specific parameters or a randomized map.
The sensitivity analysis.py file is used to show variability and mean influence by altering parameters while keeping the rest static.
